            There once lived a pirate named Gol D. Roger. He obtained wealth,
            fame, and power to earn the title of Pirate King. When he was
            captured and about to be executed, he revealed that his treasure
            called One Piece was hidden somewhere at the Grand Line. This made
            all people set out to search and uncover the One Piece treasure, but
            no one ever found the location of Gol D. Roger's treasure, and the
            Grand Line was too dangerous a place to overcome. Twenty-two years
            after Gol D. Roger's death, a boy named Monkey D. Luffy decided to
            become a pirate and search for Gol D. Roger's treasure to become the
            next Pirate King.

            Many years ago, in the hidden village of Konoha, lived a great demon
            fox. When it swung one of it's nine tails, a tsunami occurred. The
            fourth hokage sealed this demon fox inside a boy in exchange for his
            own life. Naruto was that boy, and he grew up with no family, and
            the villagers hated him thinking that he himself was the demon fox.
            Naruto's dream is to become Hokage, and have the villagers
            acknowledge him.
